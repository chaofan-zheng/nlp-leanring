    "A `for` loop is just a way to do something repeatedly to every item in a list, or every letter in a string, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The anatomy of a for loop is: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in myList: \n",
    "    doThingToItem(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It has to start with `for`\n",
    "2. The first line must end with a colon `:`\n",
    "3. The subsequent lines in the loop have to be indented (four spaces)\n",
    "4. `item` is just my name for the item in the loop that we're dealing with now. We could call this anything, so long as we're consistent. \n",
    "5. `myList` is the list we're iterating over. "
